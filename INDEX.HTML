        <p class="sectionsubTag textsmall">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or 
            the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational 
            methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. 
            Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners 
            can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings
             and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts 
             may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality
            and efficiency of education towards applicable relevance in the students' lives
            and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large or for evidence
            -based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some 
            governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the
             Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In 
             most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubTag textsmall">The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of 
            scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman 
            civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which 
            allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires 
            saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread
             out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from
              other civilizations â€“ as with the Jesuit China missions who played a significan
              t role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and
               Europe, translating works from Europe like Euclid's Elements for Chinese scholars
                and the thoughts of Confucius for European audiences. The Enlightenment saw the
                 emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe. Much of modern 
                 traditional Western and Eastern education is based on the Prussian education 
                 system.[13]</p>
